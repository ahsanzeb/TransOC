The trap can be loaded by creating polaritons 50 micrometers from its center that are allowed to drift into the trap. When the density of polaritons exceeds a critical threshold, we observe a number of signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation: spectral and spatial narrowing, a peak at zero momentum in the momentum distribution, first-order coherence, and spontaneous linear polarization of the light emission. The polaritons, which are eigenstates of the light-matter system in a microcavity, remain in the strong coupling regime while going through this dynamical phase transition.},

We report on a cavity optomechanical system in which a collective density excitation of a Bose-Einstein condensate serves as the mechanical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. A few photons inside the ultrahigh-finesse cavity trigger strongly driven back-action dynamics, in quantitative agreement with a cavity optomechanical model. We approach the strong coupling regime of cavity optomechanics, where a single excitation of the mechanical oscillator substantially influences the cavity field. The results open up new directions for investigating mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime and the border between classical and quantum physics.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the fundamental understanding and active control of quantum fluids of light in nonlinear optical systems. In presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically non-equilibrium nature. We present a rich variety of photon hydrodynamical effects that have been recently observed, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While our review is mostly focused on a class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (namely planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of our article is devoted to a review of the exciting perspectives to achieve strongly correlated photon gases. In particular, we present different mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade, we discuss the novel quantum phases that are expected to appear in arrays of strongly nonlinear cavities, and we point out the rich phenomenology offered by the implementation of artificial gauge fields for photons.},

In particular, our model can be applied to the case of intersubband transitions in doped semiconductor quantum wells embedded in a microcavity. The coupling of the intracavity photonic mode and of the electronic polarization to the external, frequency-dependent, dissipation baths is taken into account by means of quantum Langevin equations in the input-output formalism. Observable spectra (reflection, absorption, transmission and electroluminescence) are calculated analytically in the case of a time-independent vacuum Rabi frequency.},

Given this array of existing and potential applications and the almost 50 years of NV research, one would expect that the physics of the centre is well understood, however, the study of the NV centre has proved challenging, with many early assertions now believed false and many remaining issues yet to be resolved. This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre. As a result, the key unresolved issues concerning the NV centre are identified and the possible avenues for their resolution are examined.},

  Abstract                 = {Organic microcavities can be engineered to reach exotic quantum regimes of strong and ultrastrong light-matter coupling. However, the microscopic interpretation of their spectroscopic signals can be challenging due to the competition between coherent and dissipative processes involving electrons, vibrations and cavity photons. We develop here a theoretical framework based on the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model and a Markovian treatment of dissipation to account for previously unexplained spectroscopic features of organic microcavities consistently. We identify conditions for the formation of dark vibronic polaritons, a new class of light-matter excitations that are not visible in absorption but lead to strong photoluminescence lines. We show that photon leakage from dark vibronic polaritons can be responsible for enhancing photoluminescence at the lower polariton frequency, and also explain the apparent breakdown of reciprocity between absorption and emission in the vicinity of the bare molecular transition frequency. Successful comparison with experimental data demonstrates the applicability of our theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Organic microcavities are photonic nanostructures that strongly confine the electromagnetic field, allowing exotic quantum regimes of light-matter interaction with disordered organic semiconductors. The unambiguous interpretation of the spectra of organic microcavities has been a long-standing challenge due to several competing effects involving electrons, vibrations and cavity photons. Here we present a theoretical framework that is able to describe the main spectroscopic features of organic microcavities consistently. We introduce a class of light-matter excitations called dark vibronic polaritons, which strongly emit but only weakly absorb light in the same frequency region of the bare electronic transition. Successful comparison with experimental data demonstrates the applicability of our theory. The proposed microscopic understanding of organic microcavities paves the way for the development of optoelectronic devices enhanced by quantum optics.},

  Abstract                 = {Phase transitions to quantum condensed phases--such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), superfluidity, and superconductivity--have long fascinated scientists, as they bring pure quantum effects to a macroscopic scale. BEC has, for example, famously been demonstrated in dilute atom gas of rubidium atoms at temperatures below 200 nanokelvin. Much effort has been devoted to finding a solid-state system in which BEC can take place. Promising candidate systems are semiconductor microcavities, in which photons are confined and strongly coupled to electronic excitations, leading to the creation of exciton polaritons. These bosonic quasi-particles are 10(9) times lighter than rubidium atoms, thus theoretically permitting BEC to occur at standard cryogenic temperatures. Here we detail a comprehensive set of experiments giving compelling evidence for BEC of polaritons. Above a critical density, we observe massive occupation of the ground state developing from a polariton gas at thermal equilibrium at 19 K, an increase of temporal coherence, and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence and linear polarization, all of which indicate the spontaneous onset of a macroscopic quantum phase.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the resonance fluorescence spectra of an exciton-driven quantum dot (QD) placed inside a high-{\$}Q{\$} semiconductor cavity and interacting with an acoustic phonon bath. We derive a quantum master equation (ME) in the polaron frame which includes exciton-phonon and exciton-cavity coupling to all orders. This work details and extends the theory used in a recent issue of {\{}$\backslash$em Phys. Rev. Lett.{\}} (C. Roy and S. Hughes 2011: Phys. Rev. Lett. {\{}$\backslash$bf 106{\}} 247403) to describe the QD Mollow triplet in the regime of semiconductor cavity-QED. Here we introduce two ME forms, Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) and time-convolutionless (TC), both to second order in the system--phonon-reservoir perturbation. In the polaron frame, these two ME forms are shown to yield equivalent population dynamics and fluorescence spectra for a continuous wave (cw) driving field. We also demonstrate that a Markov approximation is valid for computing the incoherent scattering processes and we subsequently exploit the Markovian TC ME to explore the resonance fluorescence spectra of an exciton-driven QD. Both cavity-emitted and exciton-emitted spectra are studied and these are found to have qualitatively different spectral features. Using a coherent driving field, the well known characteristics of the atomic Mollow triplet are shown to be considerably modified with electron--acoustic-phonon scattering and we highlight the key effects arising from both cavity coupling and electron-phonon coupling. Regimes of pronounced cavity feeding and anharmonic cavity-QED are exemplified, and we find that the cavity coupling depends sensitively on the exciton-cavity detuning and the temperature of the phonon bath. We show how the full width at half maximum (linewidth) of the Mollow triplet sidebands varies as a function of the square of the Rabi frequency of the cw pump.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a microscopic semi-analytical theory for the description of organic molecules interacting strongly with a cavity mode. Exciton-vibration coupling within the molecule and exciton-cavity interaction are treated on an equal footing by employing a temperature-dependent variational approach. The interplay between strong exciton-vibration coupling and strong exciton-cavity coupling gives rise to a hybrid ground state, which we refer to as the lower polaron polariton. Explicit expressions for the ground-state wave function, the zero-temperature quasiparticle weight of the lower polaron polariton, the photoluminescence line strength, and the mean number of vibrational quanta are obtained in terms of the optimal variational parameters. The dependence of these quantities upon the exciton-cavity coupling strength reveals that strong cavity coupling leads to an enhanced vibrational dressing of the cavity mode, and at the same time a vibrational decoupling of the dark excitons, which in turn results in a lower polaron polariton resembling a single-mode dressed bare lower polariton in the strong-coupling regime. Thermal effects on several observables are briefly discussed.},
