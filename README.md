Simulates the hopping charge transport through an optoelectronic device in the strong matter-light coupling regime. Includes various types of neutral and charged molecular states and various electronic processes like career hopping, carrier injection and extraction, electron-hole pair creation and annihilation, etc. Calculates the matrix elements for these processes and uses a stochastic algorithm to calculate the average incoherent dynamics.
